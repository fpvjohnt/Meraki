## Project Overview

The Meraki Health Check tool provides automated health checks for Meraki wireless networks. It performs a series of checks on SSID configurations, RF profiles, channel utilization, and latency to ensure that the network is optimized for security and performance. The results of these checks can be used to identify areas where the network configuration deviates from recommended best practices.

## Features

- **SSID Configuration Check:** Validates SSID configurations, including authentication modes, encryption settings, and RADIUS server configurations.
- **RF Profile Check:** Analyzes RF profiles for channel width, minimum bitrate, and other settings.
- **Channel Utilization Check:** Monitors channel utilization to ensure that it remains within acceptable thresholds.
- **Latency Check:** Measures wireless network latency and identifies potential issues affecting performance.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python 3.12 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Virtualenv (optional but recommended)
- Visual Studio Build Tools (for Windows users)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/meraki-health-check.git
   cd meraki-health-check
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the Required Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure the Project:**

   - Edit the `config/config.yaml` file to include your Meraki Dashboard API key and any other necessary configuration settings.
   - Ensure that all thresholds and other settings are correctly set according to your network's requirements.

## Configuration

The project uses a configuration file (`config/config.yaml`) where you can define:

- Meraki Dashboard API key
- Thresholds for SSID amounts, RF profile settings, channel utilization, and latency
- Logging settings

Example `config.yaml`:

```yaml
meraki_api_key: "your_meraki_api_key_here"
thresholds:
  ssid_amount: 4
  5G Max Channel Width: 40
  5G Min Bitrate: 24
  2.4G Min Bitrate: 12
  max_channel_utilization: 75
  max_wireless_latency: 50
logging:
  level: "INFO"
  file: "logs/meraki_health_check.log"
```

## Usage

To run the health checks, execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will run the health check process for all networks configured in the `config.yaml` file. The results will be logged, and any issues identified will be displayed in the console.

### Example Output

```bash
INFO:root:Checking wireless SSIDs for network 12345
INFO:root:SSID 'Guest' is using open authentication
INFO:root:5GHz channel width (80 MHz) exceeds the recommended maximum (40 MHz)
...
```

## Running Tests

This project includes a suite of unit tests to ensure the correctness of the code. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

This will execute all tests in the `tests/` directory and provide a summary of the results.
